# XRIQ Private Devnet Prototype

This subtree contains the Rust prototype for XRIQ. It is private-devnet code
only until security and legal/compliance review says otherwise.

## Current Scope

- `xriq-core`: dependency-free protocol types and validation helpers.
- `xriq-consensus`: deterministic private-devnet block production.
- `xriq-ledger`: deterministic private-devnet account state transitions.
- `xriq-mempool`: deterministic pending-transaction checks and ordering.
- `xriq-node`: minimal local private-devnet node loop.
- `xriq-rpc`: local private-devnet RPC endpoint behavior.
- `xriq-storage`: local block storage for private-devnet tests.
- `xriq-wallet`: private-devnet wallet CLI for test identities and transfers.

## Commands

```bash
cd xriq
cargo fmt --check
cargo test
```

Keep generated chain data, node databases, wallets, and testnet artifacts out of
Git.
