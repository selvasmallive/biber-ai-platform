# Codex Handoff

Last updated: 2026-05-16

## Current Goal

Continue the live Vast.ai deployment and development of the BIBER AI Platform from
the current GPU-backed direct vLLM/FastAPI state.

## Repo State

- Local branch: `main`
- Remote: `origin` points to `https://github.com/selvasmallive/biber-ai-platform.git`
- GitHub `origin/main` was pushed from this workstation on 2026-05-16 and now
  includes the live deployment hardening, GitHub save hardening, pytest
  verification, and handoff updates.
- The pushed history includes at least:
  - `b782c05 Harden Vast direct service binding`
  - `b0462e6 Update Vast handoff state`
  - `73bd171 Refresh Vast deployment handoff`
  - `97094ea Harden GitHub save integration`
  - `0272643 Update Vast handoff after GitHub save deploy`
  - `fae51c2 Record pytest availability in handoff`
  - `fc6b1ba Record Vast pytest verification`
  - `b3a7456 Record GitHub CLI auth setup`
  - `86129dc Smoke test BIBER GitHub save`
  - `8ae20ad Prepare Vast QLoRA training path`
  - `5f10d3f Add approved internet data ingestion`
- Later local/Vast handoff commits may exist on top of those; verify with Git
  before acting on branch state.
- Use `git status --short --branch`, `git log --oneline -1`, and
  `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` for authoritative current Git state.
- Keep the Vast.ai checkout at `/workspace/biber-ai-platform` fast-forwarded
  with `git pull --ff-only origin main` after documentation or deployment
  commits are pushed.
- Prefer `git status --short --branch` and `git log --oneline -1` over this
  file for authoritative current Git state.
- GitHub CLI was installed on this workstation at
  `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe` and authenticated as `selvasmallive`.
  `gh auth setup-git` was run, and `git push origin main` verified GitHub auth
  with `Everything up-to-date`. In this Codex process, `gh` may not be on
  `PATH` until the app/session is restarted; use the full path if needed.
- Real GitHub generated-code save was smoke-tested from the live Vast.ai API
  using a temporary GitHub CLI token from this workstation. The token was not
  written to the live `.env`, temporary files were removed, and FastAPI was
  restarted back to normal no-token configuration after the test.

## Completed

- Fast-forwarded the Vast.ai checkout from `4044c5b` to `5798c7f`.
- Bootstrapped the no-Docker direct deployment path on Vast.ai.
- Verified the instance has two GPUs:
  - GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, 16311 MiB
  - GPU 1: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, 16311 MiB
- Confirmed Docker is not present on the instance; the direct deployment path is
  the correct path.
- Verified local scaffold validation passes with the bundled Codex Python runtime.
- Verified local Python syntax compile checks pass for `app`, `src`, `worker`,
  `training`, and `scripts`.
- Verified remote `pip check` reports no broken requirements after dependency
  pin updates.
- Verified remote direct smoke test passes:
  - `GET /health`
  - `GET /v1/runtime`
  - `GET /v1/models`
  - `POST /v1/chat`
- `/v1/chat` returned model content `ok` from `biber-dev-core`.
- Verified a richer live `/v1/chat` prompt through FastAPI produced a real
  Python `fib(n)` implementation from `biber-dev-core`.
- Hardened the direct deployment so FastAPI and vLLM bind to `127.0.0.1` by
  default. Use SSH tunnels unless the `.env` credentials have been replaced and
  public binding is intentionally configured.
- Restarted the live Vast.ai services after applying explicit loopback values in
  `.env`. Final `ss` output showed both listeners on `127.0.0.1` only.
- Re-verified the live Vast.ai deployment on 2026-05-16:
  - Vast checkout: `main...origin/main [ahead 2]` at that time
  - vLLM pid: `5634`
  - FastAPI pid: `6039`
  - both services listening only on `127.0.0.1`
  - `bash scripts/vast_test_direct.sh` passed
  - `/v1/chat` returned model content `ok` from `biber-dev-core`
- Hardened the GitHub generated-code save integration in `97094ea`:
  - GitHub target paths are normalized and reject empty/parent-directory paths.
  - missing GitHub owner/repo now returns a controlled configuration error
    instead of an unhandled exception.
  - GitHub API and network failures are wrapped as controlled save errors.
  - `/v1/chat` save-to-GitHub and `/v1/save/github` map disabled/config/API
    failures to clear HTTP responses.
  - added mocked client tests in `tests/test_github_client.py`.
- Deployed `97094ea` to the Vast.ai checkout through a Git bundle because
  GitHub push was blocked by credentials. Vast is now ahead of `origin/main`.
- Restarted only FastAPI after deploying `97094ea`; vLLM stayed warm.
  - vLLM pid: `5634`
  - FastAPI pid: `6759`
- Verified on Vast.ai after the FastAPI restart:
  - `/workspace/biber-venv/bin/python -m compileall app src tests` passed.
  - mocked GitHub client checks passed against the Vast virtualenv.
  - `bash scripts/vast_test_direct.sh` passed.
  - `/v1/save/github` without `GITHUB_TOKEN` returns
    `HTTP 503 {"detail":"GitHub saving is not configured."}`.
- Installed `pytest>=8,<9` into the Vast.ai virtualenv and verified
  `tests/test_github_client.py` passes:
  - Python: `/workspace/biber-venv/bin/python`
  - pytest: `8.4.2`
  - result: `5 passed`
- Verified GitHub caught up through `fc6b1ba`, then fetched `origin/main` on
  Vast.ai. Vast checkout showed `main...origin/main` with no ahead count.
- Verified real `/v1/save/github` from Vast.ai with temporary GitHub credentials:
  - FastAPI was restarted with transient `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
    `GITHUB_DEFAULT_OWNER=selvasmallive`, and
    `GITHUB_DEFAULT_REPO=biber-ai-platform`.
  - `/v1/save/github` returned `HTTP 200`.
  - GitHub URL:
    `https://github.com/selvasmallive/biber-ai-platform/blob/main/generated/github-save-smoke.md`
  - Resulting Git commit: `86129dc Smoke test BIBER GitHub save`
  - Local and Vast.ai checkouts were fast-forwarded to include the generated
    smoke-test file.
  - FastAPI was restarted back to normal mode after the smoke test:
    vLLM pid `5634`, FastAPI pid `7818`.
  - `bash scripts/vast_test_direct.sh` passed after the normal restart.
  - `/v1/runtime` reports `github_configured=false` again because no GitHub
    token is currently persisted in `.env`.
- Prepared and verified the custom-model QLoRA training path in `8ae20ad`:
  - added JSONL dataset validation utilities and tests.
  - replaced the QLoRA placeholder with a dry-runnable training entrypoint.
  - added `scripts/vast_train_qlora_tmux.sh` for long GPU jobs on the 500 GB
    Vast volume.
  - added `requirements-training.txt` without forcing a Torch/CUDA replacement.
  - local bundled-Python compile, dataset validation, and QLoRA dry-run passed.
  - local pytest was not available in the bundled Python runtime, so pytest was
    verified on the Vast virtualenv instead.
  - Vast pytest for `tests/test_training_dataset.py` passed with `4 passed`.
  - Vast compile, sample dataset validation, and QLoRA dry-run also passed.
  - no real fine-tuning job was started.
- Added the approved internet dataset ingestion pipeline in `5f10d3f`:
  - approved-source manifest: `training/approved_sources.json`
  - ingestion CLI: `training/internet_ingest.py`
  - Vast helper: `scripts/vast_ingest_internet_dataset.sh`
  - tests: `tests/test_internet_ingest.py`
  - generated datasets, raw downloads, provenance, outputs, and adapters are
    ignored by Git.
- Verified internet ingestion on Vast after pulling `5f10d3f`:
  - compile checks for `training`, `scripts`, and `tests` passed.
  - Vast pytest for `tests/test_internet_ingest.py` and
    `tests/test_training_dataset.py` passed with `8 passed`.
  - approved internet-smoke ingestion wrote
    `/workspace/data/biber_train_internet_smoke.jsonl` with 2 records.
  - raw source was stored at
    `/workspace/data/raw/biber-platform-sample-jsonl.jsonl`.
  - provenance was written to `/workspace/outputs/dataset-provenance.json`.
  - validation report was written to
    `/workspace/outputs/internet-dataset-validation.json`.
  - QLoRA dry-run accepted the internet-smoke dataset.
  - no real fine-tuning job was started.

## Live Vast.ai Deployment Status

- Host: `70.30.158.46`
- SSH port: `61995`
- SSH key path on this workstation: `C:\Users\vselv\.ssh\biber_vast_ed25519`
- Remote repo path: `/workspace/biber-ai-platform`
- Runtime root: `/workspace`
- Storage:

    as XFS.
  - Size at last check: `499G`, used `26G`, available `474G`.
  - BIBER runtime, model cache, venv, pip cache, logs, pid files, future
    datasets, checkpoints, adapters, and outputs should stay under
    `/workspace` to use the 500 GB Vast volume and avoid the small root
    filesystem.
- Virtualenv: `/workspace/biber-venv`
- Logs:
  - `/workspace/biber-logs/vllm.log`
  - `/workspace/biber-logs/api.log`
- Pid files:
  - `/workspace/biber-pids/vllm.pid`
  - `/workspace/biber-pids/api.pid`
- vLLM:
  - URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/v1`
  - Model: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct`
  - Served model name: `biber-dev-core`
  - Tensor parallel size: `2`
  - Max model length: `8192`
- BIBER FastAPI:
  - URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
  - Environment: `gpu`
  - Chat mode: `infer`
  - Run `bash scripts/vast_status_direct.sh` for current PIDs and bind details.
- Persistent training/output directories created on the 500 GB volume:
  - `/workspace/data`
  - `/workspace/checkpoints`
  - `/workspace/adapters`
  - `/workspace/outputs`

## Custom Model Training Prep

- A conservative QLoRA training path is now scaffolded for the user's own GPU.
  It is meant to keep Codex usage low: Codex prepares and verifies scripts, then
  long fine-tuning runs happen inside `tmux` on Vast.ai.
- Real training data should live on the 500 GB Vast volume at:
  - `/workspace/data/biber_train.jsonl`
- Do not commit real datasets, checkpoints, adapters, or evaluation outputs to
  Git. Keep generated model artifacts under:
  - `/workspace/checkpoints`
  - `/workspace/adapters`
  - `/workspace/outputs`
- Dataset format and validation notes are in `training/dataset_format.md`.
- The tiny `training/sample_dataset.jsonl` file is only for smoke tests.
- Dataset validation entrypoint:

```bash
cd /workspace/biber-ai-platform
/workspace/biber-venv/bin/python training/validate_dataset.py \
  --dataset /workspace/data/biber_train.jsonl \
  --min-records 10 \
  --report /workspace/outputs/dataset-validation.json \
  --print-sample
```

- QLoRA dry-run entrypoint for script/dataset plumbing:

```bash
cd /workspace/biber-ai-platform
/workspace/biber-venv/bin/python training/qlora_train_biber_dev_core.py \
  --dataset training/sample_dataset.jsonl \
  --output-dir /workspace/adapters/dry-run \
  --logging-dir /workspace/outputs/dry-run \
  --dry-run
```

- Long training launcher:

```bash
cd /workspace/biber-ai-platform
bash scripts/vast_train_qlora_tmux.sh /workspace/data/biber_train.jsonl
```

- Install `requirements-training.txt` only when preparing an actual training
  run. It intentionally avoids replacing Torch/CUDA by default; preserve the
  working vLLM CUDA stack unless a compatibility issue requires a planned
  change.
- No real fine-tuning run has been started yet. The next training milestone is
  to place a real JSONL dataset at `/workspace/data/biber_train.jsonl`, validate
  it, then launch QLoRA in `tmux` if the user approves starting the GPU job.
- Verified on Vast after pulling `8ae20ad`: compile, sample dataset validation,
  QLoRA dry-run, and `tests/test_training_dataset.py` all passed under
  `/workspace/biber-venv`.
- Internet-sourced training data must use the approved-source ingestion
  pipeline, not broad scraping:
  - manifest: `training/approved_sources.json`
  - script: `training/internet_ingest.py`
  - Vast helper: `scripts/vast_ingest_internet_dataset.sh`
  - raw downloads: `/workspace/data/raw`
  - processed JSONL: `/workspace/data/biber_train_internet.jsonl`
  - provenance: `/workspace/outputs/dataset-provenance.json`
  - validation report: `/workspace/outputs/internet-dataset-validation.json`
- The ingestion pipeline requires each enabled source to be explicitly
  `approved`, license-allowlisted, domain-allowlisted, and attributed. It also
  deduplicates records, filters likely secrets, caps record size, and validates
  the final JSONL before use.
- The current enabled internet source is only the small project-owned smoke
  dataset. Add real approved source entries before building a meaningful
  fine-tuning dataset.
- Only promote an internet-ingested dataset to `/workspace/data/biber_train.jsonl`
  after reviewing provenance and validation output.

## Important Fixes Made During Deployment

### Bootstrap script execution

`scripts/vast_bootstrap_direct.sh` now starts services with:

```bash
exec bash "${SCRIPT_DIR}/vast_start_direct.sh"
```

This avoids `Permission denied` on filesystems where the checked-out script is
not executable.

### Shared venv dependency pins

The direct deployment shares one virtualenv between FastAPI and vLLM. The older
API pins downgraded packages below what vLLM `0.21.0` expects. The current API
requirements now include:

```text
fastapi==0.136.1
starlette==0.52.1
pydantic==2.13.4
```

Remote `pip check` passed after applying these pins.

### Loopback bind defaults

`scripts/lib/vast_direct_common.sh` defaults both services to loopback:

```text
BIBER_API_HOST=127.0.0.1
BIBER_VLLM_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

Set either host to `0.0.0.0` only after replacing the starter credentials and
intentionally exposing the instance.

## Moving To A New Vast GPU

Use this section when replacing the current Vast.ai GPU. The goal is to avoid
re-downloading or rebuilding large assets when the current GPU or its storage is
still reachable, while keeping the new instance reproducible from GitHub if the
current GPU is unavailable.

### If the current GPU is still available

1. First make GitHub authoritative for code:

```bash
cd /workspace/biber-ai-platform
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline -1
```

From this workstation, push any local commits before moving:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\vselv\OneDrive\Biber\biber-ai-platform
git push origin main
```

2. Rent the new Vast.ai GPU. Prefer the same OS/template family and enough disk
   space for the existing runtime, model cache, datasets, and checkpoints.

3. Bootstrap code on the new GPU from GitHub:

```bash
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/selvasmallive/biber-ai-platform.git
cd biber-ai-platform
```

4. Copy only state that saves real time or cannot be recreated. Important paths:

```text
/workspace/biber-ai-platform/.env     # secrets/config; copy carefully
/workspace/.hf_home                   # Hugging Face/model cache; saves download time
/workspace/pip-cache                  # optional; saves pip download time
/workspace/data                       # future datasets, if present
/workspace/checkpoints                # future training checkpoints, if present
/workspace/adapters                   # future LoRA/QLoRA adapters, if present
/workspace/outputs                    # future evaluation/training outputs, if present
```

Do not copy pid files:

```text
/workspace/biber-pids
```

Logs are optional:

```text
/workspace/biber-logs
```

5. Prefer Vast.ai's instance/volume copy tools or same-provider local network
   copy when available, because that can be faster and may avoid routing large
   transfers through this workstation.

If both old and new instances are reachable to Vast's copy service, use command
shapes like these with the actual Vast instance IDs:

```bash
vastai copy C.<OLD_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/.hf_home/ C.<NEW_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/.hf_home/
vastai copy C.<OLD_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/pip-cache/ C.<NEW_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/pip-cache/
vastai copy C.<OLD_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/data/ C.<NEW_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/data/
vastai copy C.<OLD_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/checkpoints/ C.<NEW_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/checkpoints/
vastai copy C.<OLD_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/adapters/ C.<NEW_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/adapters/
```

For a Vast 500 GB volume, remember that Vast volumes are local to the machine
where they were created. If the same machine can still be used, rent the new
instance using the existing volume. If moving to a different machine, create a
new destination volume/instance and copy data instead of assuming the old volume
can be attached directly:

```bash
vastai copy V.<OLD_VOLUME_ID>:/data/ V.<NEW_VOLUME_ID>:/data/
vastai copy V.<OLD_VOLUME_ID>:/data/ C.<NEW_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/
vastai copy C.<OLD_INSTANCE_ID>:/workspace/ V.<NEW_VOLUME_ID>:/data/
```

If using manual SSH copy, run it from a Linux shell that can reach both
instances. Example shape:

```bash
rsync -aH --info=progress2 \
  -e "ssh -p <OLD_SSH_PORT> -i <SSH_KEY>" \
  root@<OLD_HOST>:/workspace/.hf_home/ /workspace/.hf_home/

rsync -aH --info=progress2 \
  -e "ssh -p <OLD_SSH_PORT> -i <SSH_KEY>" \
  root@<OLD_HOST>:/workspace/pip-cache/ /workspace/pip-cache/

rsync -aH --info=progress2 \
  -e "ssh -p <OLD_SSH_PORT> -i <SSH_KEY>" \
  root@<OLD_HOST>:/workspace/biber-ai-platform/.env /workspace/biber-ai-platform/.env
```

For training datasets/checkpoints, copy the relevant directories only if they
exist:

```bash
rsync -aH --info=progress2 \
  -e "ssh -p <OLD_SSH_PORT> -i <SSH_KEY>" \
  root@<OLD_HOST>:/workspace/data/ /workspace/data/

rsync -aH --info=progress2 \
  -e "ssh -p <OLD_SSH_PORT> -i <SSH_KEY>" \
  root@<OLD_HOST>:/workspace/checkpoints/ /workspace/checkpoints/

rsync -aH --info=progress2 \
  -e "ssh -p <OLD_SSH_PORT> -i <SSH_KEY>" \
  root@<OLD_HOST>:/workspace/adapters/ /workspace/adapters/
```

If a training job is actively writing checkpoints, stop or pause the job first,
or run `rsync` twice so the second pass catches changed files.

6. Start the new GPU direct deployment:

```bash
cd /workspace/biber-ai-platform
bash scripts/vast_bootstrap_direct.sh
bash scripts/vast_test_direct.sh
bash scripts/vast_status_direct.sh
```

7. Update this handoff immediately with the new host, SSH port, runtime paths,
PIDs, bind status, test result, and whether caches/datasets/checkpoints were
copied or rebuilt.

8. Keep the old GPU only until the new GPU is verified. After verification,
stop or destroy the old instance according to the user's cost/risk preference.
Remember: stopped storage can still cost money; destroyed instance storage is
not recoverable unless copied/backed up first.

### If the current GPU is not available

1. Treat the new GPU as a clean rebuild from GitHub:

```bash
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/selvasmallive/biber-ai-platform.git
cd biber-ai-platform
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Recreate `.env` from the user's secure password manager or prior private
backup. Do not paste secrets into chat or docs. Keep loopback values unless
public exposure is intentionally configured:

```text
BIBER_API_HOST=127.0.0.1
BIBER_VLLM_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

3. Rebuild runtime and re-download model cache:

```bash
bash scripts/vast_bootstrap_direct.sh
bash scripts/vast_test_direct.sh
bash scripts/vast_status_direct.sh
```

4. Restore datasets/checkpoints/adapters from whatever backup exists. If no
backup exists, assume training data/checkpoints on the unavailable GPU are lost
and continue from GitHub plus any local/cloud copies.

5. Update this handoff with the new state and explicitly mark which assets were
rebuilt, restored, or lost.

## Reconnect And Test

From Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
ssh -i C:\Users\vselv\.ssh\biber_vast_ed25519 -p 61995 root@70.30.158.46 -L 8080:localhost:8080 -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 -L 8001:127.0.0.1:8001
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
http://127.0.0.1:8001/v1/models
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Do not paste private key contents, Vast API keys, Jupyter tokens, or `.env`
secrets into chat or docs.

## Useful Remote Commands

After SSH:

```bash
cd /workspace/biber-ai-platform
bash scripts/vast_status_direct.sh
bash scripts/vast_test_direct.sh
```

Restart only the BIBER direct services:

```bash
cd /workspace/biber-ai-platform
bash scripts/vast_stop_direct.sh
bash scripts/vast_start_direct.sh
```

Rerun bootstrap if the environment is partially missing:

```bash
cd /workspace/biber-ai-platform
bash scripts/vast_bootstrap_direct.sh
```

Follow logs:

```bash
tail -f /workspace/biber-logs/api.log
tail -f /workspace/biber-logs/vllm.log
```

## Important Config Notes

- `.env` exists on the Vast.ai instance.
- `.env` explicitly contains:
  - `BIBER_API_HOST=127.0.0.1`
  - `BIBER_VLLM_HOST=127.0.0.1`
- A redacted credential audit on 2026-05-16 showed the live `.env` still uses
  starter values for sensitive placeholders. Live rotation was not performed
  because changing running API credentials requires explicit user approval.
- Before public exposure, replace all starter credentials in `.env`:
  - `BIBER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
  - `BIBER_DEMO_API_KEY`
  - `BIBER_API_KEYS`
  - `BIBER_PASSCODE_FULL_GPU`
  - `BIBER_PASSCODE_20_GPU`
  - `BIBER_PASSCODE_QUEUE_PRIORITY`
  - `BIBER_PRIORITY_PASSCODES`
  - `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`
  - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
- The direct path starts only:
  - `biber-dev-core` through vLLM
  - BIBER FastAPI
- The direct path does not start MySQL, Redis, or Adminer.
- Optional integrations are currently not configured on the live instance:
  - OpenAI mentor
  - durable GitHub generated-code save credentials
  - Azure Blob backups

## Operating Notes For Future Codex Sessions

- Do not rotate live credentials routinely. Treat credential rotation as an
  explicit, infrequent operation that requires user approval and a plan for
  preserving the new secrets outside chat.
- Keep the deployment loopback-only while starter credentials remain in place.
- Cost-saving strategy: use Codex minimally for engineering setup, script
  changes, error diagnosis, evaluation/deployment glue, and handoff updates.
  Run long model work directly on the user's Vast.ai GPU instead of keeping a
  Codex session active. Start training, fine-tuning, batch evaluation, and other
  multi-hour jobs in `tmux`/`screen` on the GPU; disconnect while they run; bring
  Codex back only for failures, log review, result interpretation, or the next
  code/deployment change.
- Future custom-model phases should prefer the user's own GPU and eventual
  fine-tuned `biber-dev-core` model over paid external model APIs. Keep optional
  mentor APIs disabled unless the user explicitly wants them for quality review.
- Update this handoff at important points so a new Codex session can resume
  accurately from the current Vast.ai state. Important points include:
  - live service restarts or failures
  - host, SSH port, key path, runtime path, pid, or log path changes
  - Git commit/branch/remote state changes
  - dependency, model, port, bind, or environment changes
  - smoke test, runtime test, mentor, GitHub save, Azure backup, MySQL, or Redis
    status changes
  - credential status changes, without recording secret values

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Build or copy the real custom-model JSONL dataset to the 500 GB Vast volume.
   If using internet data, use `scripts/vast_ingest_internet_dataset.sh` and
   review provenance before promoting it to `/workspace/data/biber_train.jsonl`.
2. Validate the promoted dataset with `training/validate_dataset.py` and save the report
   under `/workspace/outputs`.
3. Install `requirements-training.txt` only when ready to start fine-tuning,
   preserving the current CUDA/Torch stack unless troubleshooting requires a
   planned change.
4. Launch the QLoRA job with `scripts/vast_train_qlora_tmux.sh` so the GPU keeps
   working after Codex disconnects.
5. Keep the API private over SSH tunnels unless credentials are deliberately
   rotated and public binding is intentionally enabled.
6. Keep the Vast.ai checkout fast-forwarded with local/GitHub `main`.
7. Add optional OpenAI mentor credentials if desired.
8. Add a durable fine-grained GitHub token to Vast `.env` if persistent
   generated-code save should stay enabled.
9. Add Azure Blob connection string and test backups.
10. Replace demo API key/passcode auth with database-backed credentials.
11. Add real MySQL persistence and Redis worker integration.
